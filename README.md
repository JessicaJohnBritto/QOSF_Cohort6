# Simulating open quantum systems using noise models and NISQ devices with quantum error mitigation

We present simulations of two Open Quantum System models (OQS), Collisional and Markovian Resorvoir, with noisy simulations, 
error mitigation, and with IBM devices. Extending the results of García-Pérez, et al. [npj Quantum Information 6.1 (2020): 1]. 
Using the Mitiq toolkit, we apply Zero-Noise extrapolation (ZNE), an error mitigation technique and analyze their deviation from the theoretical results 
for the models under study. For the correlated collisional model, we observed that its sinusoidal curve dampens with an increase in the number of collisions, 
and by applying ZNE, we were able to reduce the error and overlap it with the theoretical curve. We see similar behavior with the Markovian reservoir engineering.
